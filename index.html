    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>The projects you showcase, and how you showcase them, will directly affect how hiring managers will assess you as
        a candidate—so it’s important to get it right.</p>
    <p>If you’re new to the field of software engineering, you might be worried about only having one or two projects to
        include. But quality trumps quantity every time.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, employers want to see two main things: Technical programming skills (e.g coding languages and
        debugging), and soft skills (e.g project management, leadership, problem-solving).</p>
    <p>As long as you can demonstrate a versatile array of the in-demand skills employers are after, you won’t need to
        worry about your lack of high-profile projects. Everyone has to start somewhere!</p>
    <p>Make sure you embellish your projects with descriptions and documentation. Explain in clear terms what the goal
        was, the role you played, the approach you took, and what you learned. What coding languages did you use? How
        did you build, test, iterate? What was the impact of this work?</p>
    <p>A handy way of doing this is by making a screen recording of yourself talking through the project, using a tool
        like Loom. It’s a great way to convey your process to show potential employers how you approach programming
        tasks.</p>
    <p>Employers want to see your work in action, so don’t forget to include relevant links.</p>
    <p>This could be linked to source code, using repositories like Github. But could also be links to apps, websites,
        or software you’ve built. As long as you go beyond screenshots, you’re on the right track!</p>
